These files are used to generate the Figure 12.

There are three traces: lanchC.txt is collected when launching Chrome, launchY.txt is launching YouTube, and using ACFYT is collected when using five apps.

Python scripts are provided to process the traces to show the predicted results.

Usage:

1. Modify the name of trace files in these three scripts. (launchC.txt, launchY.txt, usingACFYT.txt)
2. Modify the parameters: sampling and window (keep the "*1000000").
